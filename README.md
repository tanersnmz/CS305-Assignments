# CS305 - Programming Languages
This course discusses the concepts underlying the design, definition, implementation, and use of modern programming languages for a variety of programming
paradigms, such as imperative, functional, logic and concurrent programming paradigms. The syntax and semantics of programming languages are described
using formal approaches, and basic concepts of language analysis and compilation are covered using modern tools.
